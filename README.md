# 🧾 Certificate DApp

Certificate DApp is a decentralized application built on Ethereum blockchain to issue and retrieve certificates. It allows institutions to issue blockchain-verified certificates that can be easily retrieved and verified by individuals.

## 🎯 Purpose

The DApp is designed to allow educational institutions or other organizations to issue tamper-proof certificates on the blockchain. Users can retrieve certificates by providing the certificate ID, ensuring trust, transparency, and decentralization.

- **Metamask**: A browser extension to interact with Ethereum-based applications.

## ⚙️ Run Locally

Clone the Project and change into the directory

```
https://github.com/PaiGoManh/Certificate-DApp_Blockchain.git
cd Certificate-DApp_Blockchain
```

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```
```
npm i hardhat
```
```
npm hardhat compile
```
Add a main network to hardhat.config.
- here im using sepolia and infura 
- add your api key for your sepolia from infura
- add your metamask private key 
eg.
```
module.exports = {
  defaultNetwork:"infurasepolia",
  networks: {
    localhost: {
      url:"http://127.0.0.1:8545/"
    },
    infurasepolia: {
      url :"your api key of infura or any other accounts",
      accounts:["your metamask private key"]
    }
  },
  solidity: "0.8.20",
};
```
```
npx hardhat node
```
open another terminal in vscode(ctrl+shift+`)

```
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Cert.js
``` 
open another terminal in vscode(ctrl+shift+`)

```
cd ui
npm i 
```
Go to folder src/SCdata

- add Abi code to cert.json file
- add deployed address to deployedaddress.json(deployed address will get after deploying the contract)
  
```
npm run dev
```
- connect your metamask
- issue certificate
- enter details
- make payment in metamask
- after metamask confirm get you certificate by enter your uinique id
